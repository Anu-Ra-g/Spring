## Spring Framework

In general, we as users have the control of object creation and management but in **Inversion of Control** is a design principle in which the control of object creation and management is transferred from the application code (i.e., the user or developer) to a container or framework like Spring. 

Dependency injection is the actual implementation of Inversion of Control (IoC). There are three ways to achieve Dependency injection. They are :
1. Constructor injection
2. Setter injection
3. Field Injection
